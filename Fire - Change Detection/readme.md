# Change Detection using Sentinel-1 SAR images

## Introduction
A change detection method utilising Google Earth Engine and Sentinel-1 imagery, based on the method described by Canty et.al, (2020), was used to detect the changes in height of illegal waste sites. 

Four images from May 2015 were obtained of the former Alex Smiles Limited recycling facility in Deptford Terrace, Sunderland. This study area was chosen because it was the location of rapidly changing waste site heights in the weeks before its eventual closure in May 2015.

Areas where there is a change in the height of waste, were identified and maps of changes for each epoch created.

## Results

The analysis shows that change detection using Sentinel-1 SAR images is a possible method for monitoring waste site heights through time.

Red (1) pixels are positive definite changes, blue (2) pixels are negative definite changes and yellow (3) pixels are indefinite changes.
