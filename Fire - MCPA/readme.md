# Multi-Criteria Probability Analysis

## Introduction
A multi-criteria approach combining satellite imagery and GIS, based on the methods in Karimi et. al, (2022), was used to detect areas which have a high probability of having an illegal waste site. 

Variables included existing waste sites, the road network, land use (industrial and agricultural), average land surface temperatures (day and night) and an enhanced vegetation index. Weighting based on discussions with experts were used to combine the variables. Two layers were created, one for industrial weightings and one for agricultural weightings.
