# Vulnerability Towards Snow and Cold Weather

## Socio-Economic Vulnerability
Based on the reviewed literature and available data, the following factors were selected as measures of vulnerability for households in Lower Level Super Output Areas (LSOA):

* Average monthly household income.
* Percentage of health deprived and disabled people.
* Percentage of people over 70 years old.
* Percentage of dependent children.
* Availability of central heating in households.
* Ages of houses and percentage of older houses within LSOAs.

## Adverse Weather Parameters Affecting  Vulnerability
The weather variables, extracted for Storm Darcy and the Beast From the East, through the integration of ERA5 data were incorporated as:
* Snow cover
* Snow density
* Snow depth
* Snowfall
* Snow melt
* Surface temperature
