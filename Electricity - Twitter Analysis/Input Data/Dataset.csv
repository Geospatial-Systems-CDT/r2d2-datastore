311,2022-10-11,21:31:51,NE26,@Northpowergrid Whitley Bay NE26. We've had no communication from you so I assume power cut only affected the street behind. I assume the generator was a last resort to restore power which is fair enough.
312,2022-10-11,21:14:14,I,Sound on. This diesel generator has appeared in our back lane tonight @Northpowergrid. Seems there was a power cut to 'less than 10' properties this morning (don't think we were one) and this is the solution. Glad I sleep at the front of the house! https://t.co/RdgBfpFvA4

114,2022-03-23,19:19:48,DN41,@Northpowergrid DN41 power cuts are absolutely ridiculous now. No notification of what is happening and we don’t even know why it’s happening. Why replace fuel filters at 7 o clock at night?? Replace them in the day when everyone’s at work? People are being given different stories each call!!!!
115,2022-03-23,19:02:37, ,@Northpowergrid So what you’re actually saying is instead of switching out a faulty generator you’re just going to leave us with rolling blackouts until Friday or Saturday depending on when you can get us back onto the grid? How hard is it to organise a replacement generator? One email maybe?
116,2022-03-23,18:58:07, ,@Northpowergrid Tonight! The last six nights it’s cut out and we’ve been given dozens of reasons except the glaring obvious one that the generator isn’t fit for purpose ergo should be replaced for one that is. also they’ve had all day to switch the filters why pick dinner time for most families?
117,2022-03-23,18:55:48,I,@Northpowergrid I can only assume you’re going to use this issue to get a refund/discount on the cost and the fact it inconveniences 400+ homes hasn’t even entered into the decision process. Disgraceful customer service!
